# COMP0124 N-Snake Neural Network Solution

PyTorch implementations for the Independent Q Learning and Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient algorithms to play the N-Snake game.

## Prerequisites

Please install the required packages through:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Instructions

Run ```nn_agent/train.py``` to re-train the agents, feel free to play around with hyperparameters located in ```nn_agent/util.py```.

To test the trained agents, run ```nn_agent/test.py```.

## View Results

Navigate to ```nn_agent/save/tests``` to see GIFs generated for the test runs of each algorithm.
